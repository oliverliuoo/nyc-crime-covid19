## DATA ISSUE

First, we found that there are limited data available for the year 2020 during the clean-up process. In the actual graphing part, we made some data transformations to hope to get rid of the potential bias caused by limited data.  Beyond this, we also found that there are significant unknown or empty entries in the dataset, especially in the biological description for both suspect and victim.
