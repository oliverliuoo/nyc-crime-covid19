First, the re-categorization of crime types and location might not be accurate enough, some crimes are not well categorized and lots of them are assigned to OTHERS in our rules. Second, though we did learn some association between covid-19 and crime rate. Just time series plot is not convincing enough. We might include more data like employment data to support more solid and concrete analysis. 7.2 Future work We look forward to diving deeper into the connections between covid-19 and crimes. To do so we will collect more diverse data to try to bring insights from different perspectives. Also we hope to give finer classification of crimes and locations in the future. 7.3 Lesson learned The biggest lesson we learned is that, we really need to be “question-oriented” while doing visualizations. Always keep in mind the question we wanna answer, we want the visualization to help us answer actual questions we concern about but generate a fancy graph. Sometimes easy graph can answer much better your question than a complex and beautiful one. 7.4 R Markdown "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
