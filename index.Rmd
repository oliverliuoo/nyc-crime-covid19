# Introduction
We will try to answer some of the following questions that we have interest in.

1. What are the main features of crimes in NYC. We mainly concern about five Ws: What? Where? When? Who? Whom? --- What happend? Where and when did it happen? Who's more
likely to be the victim and who's more likely to be the criminal? We hope knowing these could
keep us safer (at least feel safer) in this city.

2. How did the Pandemic affect crimes in NYC? Is there a noticeable increase in the number of cases, or the severity of the crime?

3. Geological disparity of crime rate has always existed among different districts in NYC. How did the
crime rate differs in different area(precinct) in new york city? Is the occurence of different crimes
evenly distributed among all precincts?
