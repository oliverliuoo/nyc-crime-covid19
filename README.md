## EDAV: NYC Crime and Covid-19
book link: https://oliverliuoo.github.io/nyc-crime-covid19/

### Introduction
We will try to answer some of the following questions that we have interest in.

1. Geological disparity of crime rate has always existed among different districts in NYC. Under years of city construction, is there a decrease in crime rate in those districts with high crime rates?

2. How did the Pandemic affect crimes in NYC? Is there a noticeable increase in the number of cases, or the severity of the crime?

3. As vaccination rate increased in the past year, the city has gradually recovered from the pandemic, how does this affect the unemployment rate, and more importantly, is there a connection between the unemployment rate and NY crime?
