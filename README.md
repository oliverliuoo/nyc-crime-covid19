## EDAV: NYC Crime and Covid-19
book link: https://oliverliuoo.github.io/nyc-crime-covid19/

### Introduction
We will try to answer some of the following questions that we have interest in.

1. What are the main features of crimes in NYC. We mainly concern about five Ws: What? Where? When? Who? Whom? --- What happend? Where and when did it happen? Who's more
likely to be the victim and who's more likely to be the criminal? We hope knowing these could
keep us safer (at least feel safer) in this city.

2. How did the Pandemic affect crimes in NYC? Is there a noticeable increase in the number of cases, or the severity of the crime?

3. Geological disparity of crime rate has always existed among different districts in NYC. How did the
crime rate differs in different area(precinct) in new york city? Is the occurence of different crimes
evenly distributed among all precincts?

### Future Plan
#### Data 
Already done.
#### Cleaning
Oliver will be working on the NYC crime dataset, and Sitong will handle the data about Covid-19.
#### Visualize
First for visualization of single varibales, we will split it up into two parts and each accomplish one.
And for the visualization of interaction bewteen each feature and target variable, we also split it up evenly.
#### Interactive
We will each implement part of the code of D3js.
#### Conclusion
We will discuss together and complete it together.
